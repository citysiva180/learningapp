React Pagination Notes 

- To paginate.. remember you would need the following elements 

    const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
    const [postsPerPage] = useState(10);

    - state should know the current page 
    - state should know how much you would like to display per page 

    const indexOfLastPost = currentPage * postsPerPage; 
    const indexOfFirstPost = indexOfLastPost - postsPerPage;
    const currentPosts = posts.slice(indexOfFirstPost, indexOfLastPost); 
  
    so, at starting, the current page will be 1 
    indexOfLastPost  = 1 * 10 
    indexOfFirstPost = 10 -
