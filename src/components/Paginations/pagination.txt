React Pagination Notes 

- To paginate.. remember you would need the following elements 

    const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
    const [postsPerPage] = useState(10);

    - state should know the current page 
    - state should know how much you would like to display per page 

    const indexOfLastPost = currentPage * postsPerPage; 
    const indexOfFirstPost = indexOfLastPost - postsPerPage;
    const currentPosts = posts.slice(indexOfFirstPost, indexOfLastPost); 
  
    so, at starting, the current page will be 1 
    indexOfLastPost  = 1 * 10  = 10
    indexOfFirstPost = 10 - 10 = 0
    currentPosts = get an array of numbers from 0 to 10


    pass these props to paginate function 

    pass the postPerpage, 
    totalposts which is currentPosts.length
    paginate which fires a function call in appjs. 

    const paginate = (pageNumber) => setCurrentPage(pageNumber); // What this does is, on clicking it will get the number clicked 
    then it sends this value to the parent, where parent will assign that number in state 


Final logic will be something like this 


import React from "react";

const Pagination = ({ postsPerPage, totalPosts, paginate }) => {
  const pageNumbers = [];

  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.ceil(totalPosts / postsPerPage); i++) {
    pageNumbers.push(i);
  }

  return (
    <nav className="pagination">
      {pageNumbers.map((number) => (
        <li key={number} className="page-item">
          <a onClick={() => paginate(number)} href="!#" className="page-link"> // The pagination will fire the function at the top component
            {number}
          </a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Pagination;

Finally, it will render an array of number links which on click will change.


Notes: Now, when I tried changing the page, I started getting errors since the URL was not properly mapped. 
Due to the changes in the react router dom 6 version, this had happened. To make this go away, you will need to 
add parameterized route to this pagination component. Only then it will work!

like this... 

<Route path="/pagination/:id" element={<Paginations />}></Route>
